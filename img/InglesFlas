The introduction is the first part of the school work but it is the last to be written. Then firstly I will tell about the content of the school work. The sources must be reliable, you can use: books, newspaper, magazines and internet. It is important the titles be short and explicative. 

One tip: Not start the session with subtitles, always put text or text and pictures between a title and a subtitle.

For doing the conclusion, you should resume all the content of the school work and explain what you (the authors) learned.

Lastly the introduction: use verbs on future tense, tell here what the problem, the possible solution, the goals, the justification of the theme and the methodology. In methodology you will describe the data collection (interviews, forms, etc). In other words the methodology describes how the study was done.

One tip: If you may come across situations where you should use explanations, to this use footer.
