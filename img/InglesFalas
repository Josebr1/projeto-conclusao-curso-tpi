I will say briefly how to do the introduction, content and conclusion of the work.
The introduction is the first part of the school work but it is the last to be written. Because to write it it's good to have all work content made. Then firstly I will tell about the school work content. The sources must be reliable, you can use: books, newspapers, magazines and internet. It is important the titles be short and explicative. 

One tip: don't start the session with subtitles, always put text or text and pictures between a title and a subtitle.

For doing the conclusion, you must sum up all the work content and explain what you (the authors) learned.

Lastly the introduction: use verbs on future tense, because the introduction says what will come. Tell here what the problem, the possible solution, the goals, the justification of the theme and the methodology. In methodology you will describe the data collection (interviews, forms, etc). In other words the methodology describes how the study was done.

Other tip: If you come across situations where you should use explanations, use footnote. It is helpful to doesn't lose your chain of thought.
